Cyclo-chimney

## Overview
  Hurricanes frequently hit Egypt, precisely in the coastal areas of the central Mediterranean route, due to the rise of warm moist air over water, which then meets cool moist air, resulting in a variety of negative consequences such as condensation of large clouds, heavy rains, which sometimes develop into flooding, massive amounts of wind, and thunderstorms. Hurricane-like systems occurred on November 7, 2014, and October 6, 2019, with the strength rising by around 0.75% each year. Predicting the variance of components influencing hurricanes can assist predict the pressure, temperature, and amount of wind that causes those storms. An approach was used by constructing two different rooms, one containing high pressure and the other low pressure in which the meeting of the two different pressures areas to generate wind that can be measured and detected by sensors, this solution has one limitation, the difference in pressure isn’t sufficient enough to cause wind generation. The chosen idea is predicting the variation of voltage generated by the wind with a voltage sensor and temperature that initiates the movement of moist air by the LM35 sensor, this was done by constructing a trapezoid-shaped area containing the electric fan and a cuboid-shaped area holding the heater, the data then appears on a Blynk GUI for graph visualization. The chosen solution meets the assigned design requirements criteria; the voltage sensor's dynamic range is 0.1v and the temperature sensor's dynamic range is 30.18°C, and the noise of each sensor is 0.755 for the voltage sensor and 0.63 for the LM35.
